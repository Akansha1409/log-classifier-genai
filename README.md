# üß† Log Classification System using BERT, Regex, and DeepSeek LLM

This project classifies log messages into appropriate categories using a hybrid approach:
- ‚úÖ Regex-based fast classification
- ‚úÖ BERT embeddings with Logistic Regression
- ‚úÖ DeepSeek LLM via Groq API for complex cases

## üß† Hybrid Classification Framework

This project implements a **hybrid log classification system**, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

### üîπ Classification Approaches

#### ‚úÖ Regular Expression (Regex)
- Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
- Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

#### ‚úÖ Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression
- Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
- Uses embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers (e.g., BERT).
- Logistic Regression acts as the classifier on top of the embeddings.

#### ‚úÖ LLM (Large Language Models) via Groq API
- Used when logs are too complex or labeled data is insufficient.
- Provides a powerful fallback using DeepSeek or similar LLMs through Groq.
- Ideal for rare edge cases and nuanced language understanding.

üöÄ How to Run
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repo and install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-classifier-genai.git
cd log-classifier-genai
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add .env with your Groq API Key
Create a .env file:

env
Copy
Edit
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the classifier
Make sure test.csv exists with this structure:

csv
Copy
Edit
source,log_message
LegacyCRM,Case escalation failed for ticket ID 1234
ModernCRM,User logged in successfully
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python classify.py
This creates output.csv with predicted labels.

4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Train Your Own Model
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open notebooks/model_training.ipynb and run all cells.

üìå Output Example
