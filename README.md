# ðŸ§  Log Classification System using BERT, Regex, and DeepSeek LLM

This project classifies log messages into appropriate categories using a hybrid approach:
- âœ… Regex-based fast classification
- âœ… BERT embeddings with Logistic Regression
- âœ… DeepSeek LLM via Groq API for complex cases

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Sentence Transformers
- Groq (DeepSeek LLM)
- Regex
- Dotenv

## ðŸ§  Hybrid Classification Framework

This project implements a **hybrid log classification system**, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

### ðŸ”¹ Classification Approaches

#### âœ… Regular Expression (Regex)
- Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
- Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

#### âœ… Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression
- Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
- Uses embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers (e.g., BERT).
- Logistic Regression acts as the classifier on top of the embeddings.

#### âœ… LLM (Large Language Models) via Groq API
- Used when logs are too complex or labeled data is insufficient.
- Provides a powerful fallback using DeepSeek or similar LLMs through Groq.
- Ideal for rare edge cases and nuanced language understanding.
